This project develops a fairness-aware job recommendation system that addresses both recommendation quality and ranking equity in large-scale job platforms. The system is designed as a two-phase recommendation pipeline. In the first phase, a hybrid recommender model is constructed by combining semantic similarity between resumes and job descriptions with collaborative filtering–based structural signals derived from occupation-level usage of skills and job requirements. Semantic similarity is computed using dense text embeddings that capture contextual relationships beyond surface-level keyword overlap, while collaborative filtering captures latent associations among occupations and skills based on historical co-occurrence patterns. These two signals are integrated through a weighted hybrid scoring function, allowing the model to leverage both contextual and structural information when generating recommendations. This approach mitigates limitations of purely content-based systems and improves robustness in scenarios where either textual similarity or collaborative signals alone may be insufficient.

The second phase of the system focuses on fairness in ranking, motivated by empirical observations that relevance-based recommenders often introduce exposure bias, disproportionately favoring postings from large employers while under-representing smaller companies in top-ranked results. To address this issue, the project proposes multiple fairness-aware reranking strategies, including a group-based fairness-weighted reranker that adjusts ranking scores according to company-size categories, and a fairness-aware diversity-constrained reranker that limits repeated exposure from the same employer within the top-K recommendations. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated using rank-aware fairness and diversity metrics, such as selection rate, rank-aware exposure, proportional fairness error, and employer diversity ratio, which collectively capture both exposure balance and recommendation heterogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that fairness-aware reranking significantly reduces exposure disparities across employer groups while maintaining competitive relevance performance, highlighting the feasibility of incorporating fairness objectives into real-world recommendation pipelines.
